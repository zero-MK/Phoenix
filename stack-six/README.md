# STACK SIX

Where does Stack Six go wrong, and what can you do with it?

Depending on the architecture youâ€™re doing this on, you may need to explore more and be creative with how to solve this level.

The macro GREET is architecture dependent.

v1.0.0-alpha-2 note: AMD64 and i486 are known working, though ARM64 and ARM may not currently be solvable.
